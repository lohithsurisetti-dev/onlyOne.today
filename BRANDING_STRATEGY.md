# 🎨 Branding & Marketing Strategy

Your domain: **`onlyonetoday.com`**  
Current brand: **`OnlyOne.today`** ⚠️ (Mismatch!)

---

## ⚠️ **THE PROBLEM:**

### **Current Situation:**
```
Domain:    onlyonetoday.com     (no dot, all together)
Brand:     OnlyOne.Today        (has dot)
Headers:   "OnlyOne.today"      (lowercase t)
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Brand name has `.today` but domain is `.com`
- ❌ Confusing for users ("Is it .today or .com?")
- ❌ Dot in brand name implies `.today` TLD
- ❌ Inconsistent capitalization

---

## ✅ **RECOMMENDED BRANDING:**

### **Option 1: "OnlyOne" (Simple & Clean)** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

**Tagline:** `One action. One day. One you.`

## 📊 **COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:**

### **How Others Do It:**

| Brand | Domain | Strategy |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Twitter** | twitter.com | Brand ≠ Domain (X.com now) |
| **Instagram** | instagram.com | Brand = Domain |
| **TikTok** | tiktok.com | Brand = Domain |
| **Discord** | discord.com | Brand = Domain |

**Best Practice:** Brand name can differ from domain as long as it's memorable!
