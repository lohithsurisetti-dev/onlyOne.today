# üìç Location Tracking & Privacy

## Overview

OnlyOne.today uses location data to enable **local** comparisons while respecting user privacy. This document explains how location works, what we track, and how it's used.

---

## üåç How Location Detection Works

### Automatic Detection
1. **On page load**, the `LocationDetector` component automatically detects your location
2. Uses **ipapi.co** (free IP geolocation API)
3. **No GPS/browser location permission required**
4. Detects: City, State/Region, Country

### Privacy-First Approach
- ‚úÖ **IP-based geolocation** (not GPS)
- ‚úÖ **No precise coordinates** stored (no lat/long)
- ‚úÖ **City-level precision** maximum
- ‚úÖ **Optional** - app works without location
- ‚úÖ **No third-party tracking**

---

## üìä What We Store

### Database Schema (`posts` table)
```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  -- ... other fields
  
  -- Location data (all optional)
  location_city TEXT,          -- e.g., "San Francisco"
  location_state TEXT,         -- e.g., "California"
  location_country TEXT,       -- e.g., "United States"
  location_coords POINT,       -- NOT USED (future feature)
  
  -- ... other fields
);
```

### What's Stored
| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `location_city` | "San Francisco" | City-level comparisons |
| `location_state` | "California" | State/region comparisons |
| `location_country` | "United States" | Country comparisons |

### What's NOT Stored
- ‚ùå IP addresses
- ‚ùå GPS coordinates
- ‚ùå Precise location data
- ‚ùå Location history
- ‚ùå Device identifiers

---

## üéØ How Location is Used

### 1. **Scope Selection**
When users create a post, they choose a comparison scope:

```typescript
const scopes = [
  'city',     // Compare within your city
  'state',    // Compare within your state/region
  'country',  // Compare within your country
  'world'     // Compare globally (default)
]
```

### 2. **Uniqueness Calculation**
Location affects uniqueness scoring:

```sql
-- Example: Find similar posts in the same city
SELECT * FROM posts 
WHERE content_hash = 'ate:pizza'
  AND location_city = 'San Francisco'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
```

**Example Scenarios:**

| Activity | Scope | Location | Result |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| "Ate pizza" | City | San Francisco | Compare with SF residents only |
| "Ate pizza" | State | California | Compare with all Californians |
| "Ate pizza" | Country | USA | Compare with all Americans |
| "Ate pizza" | World | (any) | Compare globally |

### 3. **Feed Filtering** (Future Feature)
Will enable:
- View posts from your city
- View posts from nearby areas
- Discover local trends

---

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Protection
1. **Minimal Collection**: Only city/state/country
2. **No PII**: Location is NOT personally identifiable
3. **Optional**: App works without location
4. **Encrypted**: Data encrypted at rest & in transit (Supabase)
5. **No Sharing**: Location never sold or shared with third parties

### User Control
Users can:
- ‚úÖ See detected location before posting
- ‚úÖ Choose scope (city/state/country/world)
- ‚úÖ Use app without providing location
- ‚úÖ Posts work fine with location = NULL

### GDPR & CCPA Compliance
- ‚úÖ **Right to Access**: Users can see their location data
- ‚úÖ **Right to Delete**: Posts can be deleted (including location)
- ‚úÖ **Minimal Data**: Only what's necessary for functionality
- ‚úÖ **Transparency**: Clear explanation of location use

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Frontend (app/page.tsx)
```typescript
// 1. Detect location on page load
const [userLocation, setUserLocation] = useState<LocationData | null>(null)

// 2. Pass to API when creating post
const result = await createPost({
  content: data.content,
  inputType: data.inputType,
  scope: data.scope,
  locationCity: userLocation?.city,      // ‚úÖ Optional
  locationState: userLocation?.state,    // ‚úÖ Optional
  locationCountry: userLocation?.country, // ‚úÖ Optional
})
```

### Backend (app/api/posts/route.ts)
```typescript
// 1. Validate location data (security)
const locationValidation = validateLocation({
  city: locationCity,
  state: locationState,
  country: locationCountry
})

// 2. Sanitize before storing
const sanitized = locationValidation.sanitized

// 3. Store in database
const result = await createPost({
  // ... other fields
  locationCity: sanitized.city,
  locationState: sanitized.state,
  locationCountry: sanitized.country,
})
```

### Database Query (lib/services/posts.ts)
```typescript
// Find similar posts with location filtering
const { data: similarPosts } = await supabase
  .from('posts')
  .select('*')
  .eq('content_hash', contentHash)
  .eq('location_city', locationCity)  // City filter
  .gte('created_at', twentyFourHoursAgo)
```

## üìà Analytics Use Cases

### Useful Insights (Future Features)
1. **Local Trends**: "Most popular activity in SF today"
2. **Regional Differences**: "NYC vs LA activity patterns"
3. **Country Comparisons**: "USA vs UK unique activities"
4. **Heatmaps**: Visual representation of activity by location

### Example Queries
```sql
-- Top cities by unique activities
SELECT 
  location_city,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE uniqueness_score >= 70) as unique_posts,
  COUNT(*) as total_posts
FROM posts
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY location_city
ORDER BY unique_posts DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- State-level activity breakdown
SELECT 
  location_state,
  location_country,
  AVG(uniqueness_score) as avg_uniqueness
FROM posts
GROUP BY location_state, location_country
ORDER BY avg_uniqueness DESC;
```

## üß™ Testing Location

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Open app in browser
open http://localhost:3001

# 2. Check console for location detection
# Should see: "üìç Location detected: { city, state, country }"

# 3. Create a post with different scopes
# - Try city scope
# - Try state scope
# - Try world scope

# 4. Check database
# Verify location fields are populated
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Test with location
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Testing location",
    "inputType": "action",
    "scope": "city",
    "locationCity": "San Francisco",
    "locationState": "California",
    "locationCountry": "United States"
  }'

# Test without location (should still work)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Testing without location",
    "inputType": "action",
    "scope": "world"
  }'
```

## üìû User Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Why do you need my location?**
A: To show you how your activity compares with others in your area! It's optional.

**Q: Is my exact address tracked?**
A: No! We only know your city/state/country, not your exact location.

**Q: Can I use the app without providing location?**
A: Yes! Location is completely optional. Choose "World" scope for global comparisons.

**Q: Who can see my location?**
A: Currently, location is not displayed to other users. It's only used for calculations.

**Q: Can I change my location?**
A: Location is auto-detected and cannot be manually changed (prevents gaming the system).

**Q: What if location detection fails?**
A: The app works perfectly fine without location. Just use "World" scope.
