# 🎯 Scope-Aware + Action-Based Scoring (FINAL)

## Overview
The CORRECT logic for uniqueness scoring that makes sense to users!

---

## ✅ **The Final Solution**

### **Two Key Principles:**

1. **Scope-Aware Matching** (Hierarchical)
   - City posts are part of State
   - State posts are part of Country
   - Country posts are part of World
   - World posts match EVERYTHING

2. **Action-Based Scoring** (Simple)
   - Formula: `100 - (matchCount × 10)`
   - matchCount = OTHERS in your scope
   - 100% is achievable!

---

## 🌍 **Scope Hierarchy**

```
WORLD (Global)
  ↓ includes all
COUNTRY
  ↓ includes all
STATE
  ↓ includes all
CITY (Hyper-local)
```

### **Matching Rules:**

| Your Scope | Matches |
|------------|---------|
| **World** | ALL posts (city + state + country + world) |
| **Country** | Posts in that country (city + state + country level) |
| **State** | Posts in that state (city + state level) |
| **City** | ONLY posts in that specific city |

---

## 📊 **Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Different Scopes, Same Action**

```
Post 1: "played cricket" | Scope: City (Chicago)
Post 2: "played cricket" | Scope: World

Post 1 Result:
  Matches in Chicago: 0 (only you)
  Score: 100% Unique in Chicago ✅
  Display: "Only you in Chicago!"

Post 2 Result:
  Matches globally: 1 (Post 1 counts!)
  Score: 90% Unique in World
  Display: "1 other person globally"
```

**Key: City posts ARE part of World!**

---

### **Scenario 2: Same Scope, Multiple Posts**

```
Post 1: "ate pizza" | Scope: World
Post 2: "ate pizza" | Scope: World
Post 3: "ate pizza" | Scope: World

Post 1: 0 others → 100% ✅
Post 2: 1 other → 90%
Post 3: 2 others → 80%
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Mixed Scopes**

```
Post 1: "went jogging" | Scope: City (NYC)
Post 2: "went jogging" | Scope: City (NYC)
Post 3: "went jogging" | Scope: City (LA)
Post 4: "went jogging" | Scope: World

Results:
  Post 1: 0 others in NYC → 100% in City ✅
  Post 2: 1 other in NYC → 90% in City
  Post 3: 0 others in LA → 100% in City ✅
  Post 4: 3 others globally (all 3 cities) → 70% in World
```

**Key: Each city is independent, but World sees all!**

---

## 🧮 **Formula Details**

### **Action-Based Uniqueness:**

```typescript
uniqueness = 100 - (matchCount × 10)

Where:
- matchCount = OTHERS in your scope (excluding you)
- Maximum: 100% (nobody else)
- Minimum: 0% (10+ others)
```

### **Why This Works:**

| Others | Score | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 0 | 100% | Only you! 🏆 |
| 1 | 90% | You + 1 = very rare |
| 2 | 80% | You + 2 = rare |
| 5 | 50% | You + 5 = medium |
| 10 | 0% | You + 10 = very common |

**Intuitive!** More people = lower score ✅

---

## 📱 **User Experience**

### **Posting with City Scope:**
```
User: Posts "played cricket" in Chicago
System: Checks Chicago only
Result: "100% Unique in Chicago - Only you!"
```

### **Posting with World Scope:**
```
User: Posts "played cricket" globally
System: Checks all scopes (city + state + country + world)
Result: "90% Unique in World - 1 other person"
```

### **Clear and Understandable!** ✅

## 🎨 **Display Examples**

### **Response Page:**
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ 100% Unique              │
│ Only you in Chicago!     │ ← Scope context!
│                          │
│ Your Action:             │
│ "played cricket"         │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### **Feed Card:**
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Unique 90% · 1           │
│ played cricket           │
│ 🌐 World                 │ ← Scope badge
└──────────────────────────┘
```

## ⚙️ **Implementation**

### **1. Scope Filter Helper:**
```typescript
export function applyScopeFilter(query, scope, location) {
  if (scope === 'world') {
    return query // No filter, match all
  }
  if (scope === 'city') {
    return query
      .eq('scope', 'city')
      .eq('location_city', location.city)
  }
  // etc...
}
```

### **2. Matching:**
```typescript
// Find similar with scope
let query = supabase
  .from('posts')
  .select('*')
  .eq('content_hash', hash)
  .gte('created_at', getTodayStart())

// Apply scope filter
query = applyScopeFilter(query, userScope, location)
```

### **3. Scoring:**
```typescript
const matchCount = results.length // Others
const score = 100 - (matchCount * 10)
```

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

After truncating, test these:

### **Test 1: City Uniqueness**
```bash
POST: { content: "played cricket", scope: "city" }
Expected: 100% Unique in City
```

### **Test 2: World Sees City**
```bash
POST: { content: "played cricket", scope: "world" }
Expected: 90% Unique in World (1 city post)
```

### **Test 3: City Independence**
```bash
# In NYC
POST: { content: "ate pizza", scope: "city" }
Expected: 100% in NYC

# In LA  
POST: { content: "ate pizza", scope: "city" }
Expected: 100% in LA (different city!)

# World
POST: { content: "ate pizza", scope: "world" }
Expected: 80% in World (2 cities)
```

   - Rewarding and motivating

2. **Scopes Have Meaning** ✅
   - City = local uniqueness
   - World = global uniqueness
   - Users choose their claim

3. **Mathematically Sound** ✅
   - Hierarchy makes sense
   - Formula is simple
   - Scores align with counts

4. **User-Friendly** ✅
   - "Only you in Chicago!"

## 🚀 **What Changed From Rarity Approach**

| Aspect | Rarity-Based (Bad) | Scope-Aware (Good) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Formula** | (total-who)/total×100 | 100-(others×10) |
| **100% Possible?** | ❌ Only if alone | ✅ Yes, in scope! |
| **Scope Impact** | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Central! |
| **User Understanding** | ❌ Confusing | ✅ Clear! |
| **With 3 posts** | 67% for all | 100%, 90%, 80% ✅ |

---

## 🎯 **Final Wisdom**

**The key insight:**
> Uniqueness is about the ACTION, not the population!

- "Only you played cricket in Chicago" = 100% ✅
- Not "You're 1 out of 3 people" = 67% ❌

**Scope-aware + Action-based = Perfect!** 🎯
