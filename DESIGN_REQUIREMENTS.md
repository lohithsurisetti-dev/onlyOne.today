   - Include padding/margin values

2. **Describe Mood:**
   - Use emotional descriptors (calm, celebratory, comforting)
   - Reference similar designs ("like looking at stars")
   - Mention user feelings

3. **Specify Interactions:**
   - Hover states
   - Active states
   - Animation triggers
   - Transition durations

4. **Include Context:**
   - Mobile vs desktop
